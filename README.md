# VirtualClass
This app will have a 3D school where learners can navigate through to get to their class, interact with their friends, and their teachers. On the available classes a teacher will assign it as a venue for a particular subject and the time it will commence. Students who have registered for this subject will be notified of this as soon as it happens. When it is five minute before the time of the class, the teacher who will be teaching it will be notified and everyone who is supposed to attend. When the class has commenced and the teacher is standing in front of their students, a teacher will be able to write on the board, paste illustrations they have prepared and there will be a teacher area where what the teacher is saying will be written. Students will have to write on their virtual note pad what the teacher has written on the board, what the teacher has said about the writing on the board and will be able to download the illustrations from the board. Students will have to raise their hands to get permission to speak from the teacher and the conversation will be written on the student area of the screen of every student in the class. Students will also be able to privately chat to each other.
